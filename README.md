# Generic+++
Generate WARP profile

The essence of the work is as follows: Create a folder somewhere, throw there generator Generic+++. exe and Generic.conf (if desired)
When running, check for internet presence - pinged google.com. Next check for wgcf.exe utility in folder.
If it is not available.
Next, check for C: Program Files AmneziaWG amneziawg.exe and Generic.conf, if there is no Generic.conf different behavior of the program.
Generic.conf - (packed in zip, because it’s not possible to attach otherwise) is a profile. Generic.conf is needed by those who don’t have any profiles at all and PHP doesn’t have anything to raise. If you don’t have a working Endpoint edit or try the options written several posts above, because without WPS to generate a profile it will not work!

Two options for work:
1. (without using Generic.conf = in the folder it is not) We connect working VPM (not in browser) start generator pop-up window in which you can specify your Endpoint or press OK will be used default option 162.159.193.1:2408 - generated 5 accounts,  (one of which is renamed to Generic.conf to be its own, not public) with the endpoint value chosen and three randomly generated JC parameters Jmin Jmax.
2. (Generic.conf in folder) If the generator detects Generic.conf then it tries to raise the tunnel with this Generic.conf (any other WPS must be disabled otherwise the tunnel will not rise), further checks the internet if all of them generate 5 configurations.
3. (You can put an exactly working profile in a folder, rename it to Generic.conf and generate profiles (configuration))
4. Added the ability to generate license profiles, license key must be in buffer. Key can be generated for example here:
